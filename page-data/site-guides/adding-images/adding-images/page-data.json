I am naming the folder \"mcm-install\"\n\nThe path for the article now looks like this ```/pages/mcm/mcm-install/```\n\nYou will need to save your mdx and supporting image files to the /mcm/mcm-install/ (for this example)\n\n\n```\npages\n│\n└───mcm    \n│   │\n│   └───mcm-install\n│   │     mcm-install.mdx\n│   │     image1.png\n│   │     image2.jpg\n\n```\n\n### Step 3: Embedding the image with markdown\nNow that the image/s are in the same local direcory as the article (mdx file), the next step is to embed them in the article itself.\n\nYou will need to copy the below code into your article\n\n```\n![](image.png)\n```\n\nThen between the brackets () you need to reference the image in the local directy as in this example\nNote: The path reference is needed before the file name.\n\n```\n![](./image1.png)\n```\n\nOptional: You can give the image a text name by adding the text you wish between the pairens []\nThis will appear if the cursor is hovered over the image.\n\n```\n![MCM login screen](./image1.png)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Save the file and prepare for upload\nNote: See upload section here\n\n\n\n## How to embed web based images\n---\n\n### Step 1: Adding the embed code to your article\nAs the image is already accessible on the internet, it does not need to be stored in the websites filesystem to be refernced. \n\n**Note:** If the image was moved or removed on the remote site, then the link to your embeded image would also be broken, pick your source wisely.\n\nTo add the image simply copy the the below code line into your article.\n\n```\n![alt text](https://images.freeimages.com/images/small-previews/5da/puzzle-world-1170892.jpg)\n```\n\nNow you can replace the URL between the brackets () to the link of your image you wish to include\n\n### Step 2: Save the file and prepare for upload\nNote: See upload section here\n\n\n\n## File Types that can be embeded\n---\nThere are many iage file types in the world.
