Dealing with multiple cloud providers is common and moving\ndata between them should be easy. In this section you will move your file from IBM Cloud\nObject Storage in Dallas to AWS S3 Storage in Frankfurt.\n\n![Overview](./images/aoc-n2n-overview.png)\n\n## Lets Go\n\n1. Navigate to the `IBM ICOS - Dallas` folder so you can see your custom filename.\n\n1. Select the `split view` button in the toolbar at the top-right of the page to open\n   another pane to the right of your existing view.\n\n   ![Split View](./images/aoc-n2n-split-view.png)\n\n1. Select the `AWS S3 - Frankfurt` directory\n\n   ![Open AWS Frankfurt](./images/aoc-n2n-open-aws.png)\n\n1. Drag and drop your file from the IBM ICOS Dallas storage in the left pane to the AWS S3\n   Frankfurt storage in the right pane to initiate a cloud-to-cloud transfer. Once you\n   drop your file into the right pane you will be notified that a copy has begun.\n\n   **Note:** You can hold `alt` when dropping to perform a `move` rather than a `copy`.\n\n   ![Copy Files Notification](./images/aoc-n2n-copying-files.png)\n\n1. View the status of the transfer by selecting the `Transfer Monitor` button from the\n   toolbar.\n\n   ![Transfer Monitor](./images/aoc-n2n-transfer-monitor.png)\n\n## Recap\n\nYou have now successfully copied your file between clouds from IBM ICOS in Dallas to AWS\nS3 in Frankfurt. It is important to note that Aspera does not modify or store these files\nin any proprietary way. Other services or processes running in the cloud can easily access\nthe content of these buckets if you allow them.\n\nYou have one more section to go. Let's take a look at how you might distribute your file\nto someone else inside or outside of your organisation.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"cc8ed236bb7a3d76764ad8f5f98a5b5d","counter":177,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cloud to Cloud Transfer","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Cloud to Cloud Transfer","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cloud to Cloud Transfer\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Cloud to Cloud Transfer\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n## Move Content between Clouds\n\nYour file is now in the cloud.
