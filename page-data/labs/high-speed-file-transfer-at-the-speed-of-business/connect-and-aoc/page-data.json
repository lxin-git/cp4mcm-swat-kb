Another option is to use the `Aspera Connect`\nclient application.\n\nAspera Connect is designed to allow simple FASP uploads and downloads using the browser.\nLets now use the Aspera Connect Client to download the file that contains the token that\nyou need for the API in the next section of this lab.\n\n![Overview](./images/aoc-download-overview.png)\n\n## Lets Go\n\n1.
