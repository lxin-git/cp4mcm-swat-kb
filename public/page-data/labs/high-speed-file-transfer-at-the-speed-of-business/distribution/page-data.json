What happens when you need to access, modify or deliver that data\nto others? Let's take a look at an application available in Aspera on Cloud called\n`Packages`.\n\nThe AoC Packages app allows you to package up content and send it like an email but of\ncourse at maximum speeds, with end-to-end security and with no file size limitations. You\nalso have the flexibility of sending content from anywhere in the world, for example; from\nICOS in Dallas or S3 in Frankfurt directly to someone.\n\nYou file now resides in AWS S3 in Frankfurt. Lets now package this file up and send it to\nourselves via email.\n\n![Overview](./images/aoc-package-overview.png)\n\n## Lets Go\n\n1. Switch to the Aspera on Cloud Packages App using the App Switcher in the toolbar at the\n   top-right of the screen.\n\n   ![App Switcher](./images/aoc-package-change-to-packages.png)\n\n1. Select the 'Send Files' button to open the Send Files form to begin composing a\n   package.\n\n   ![Send Files](./images/aoc-package-send-files.png)\n\n1. Complete the required fields in the `Send Files` form:\n\n   - **To:** This is the email that a link will be sent to where the recipient can\n     download the content you are about to send. You can enter your student email you used\n     to log in to Aspera on Cloud and you will be able to view the package in the\n     `My Inbox` tab in the left panel on the page. Note: Entering an external email\n     address has been disabled for this lab.\n   - **Subject:** Enter an email subject\n   - **Upload:** Here you can choose the contents of the package. Select `Upload` and then\n     select `Upload from Files`. You can now select your file from IBM ICOS or AWS S3 and\n     add it to the package.\n\n   **Note:** If adding multiple sources, e.g. local filesystem, IBM ICOS and AWS S3 the\n   files will each be uploaded to central storage to compose the package and then the\n   email will be sent to recipients.\n\n   ![Send Form Complete](./images/aoc-package-send-form.png)\n\n1. Click `Send`. As always you can select the `Transfer Monitor` from the toolbar to view\n   the status of the transfers.\n\n1. Once the package has been uploaded and delivered you will see the package available in\n   `My Inbox` (because you sent it to yourself) located in the left navigation bar of the\n   Packages application. Note: An email would have been sent to the email address too but\n   you don't have access to that with the demo accounts.\n\n   ![My Inbox View](./images/aoc-package-my-inbox.png)\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n  Because sending to external email accounts has been disabled in this lesson you will not\n  be able to see the email sent with the package link. You can read through the next two\n  steps to see what this would look like.\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. When a package has been delivered the end user will receive an email with a link to the\n   package.\n\n   ![Package Email Notification](./images/aoc-package-email-notification.png)\n\n   **Note:** This is the default email template. This template can be customised.\n\n1. Open the package by clicking the `Open IBM Aspera on Cloud` button and you will be\n   taken to the package view page where you can download the package.\n\n   ![Package Download](./images/aoc-package-download-page.png)\n\n## Recap\n\nIn this section you created a new Package and sent it to yourself directly from AWS S3 in\nFrankfurt or IBM ICOS in Dallas to an end-user.\n\n## The End\n\nCongratulations you have finished the lab. You have just used Aspera to transfer a file\nbetween at least three different different geographic locations using a CLI, native\nclient, browser based client and API.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"124d4a472df5093b4db3e732399d299a","counter":189,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Distribution with AoC","description":"Think Lab 5352 - Distribution with AoC","tabs":["Prerequisites","CLI","Client & CP4I","Connect & AoC","Node API","Cloud to Cloud","Distribution"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Distribution with AoC\ndescription: Think Lab 5352 - Distribution with AoC\ntabs:\n  [\n    'Prerequisites',\n    'CLI',\n    'Client & CP4I',\n    'Connect & AoC',\n    'Node API',\n    'Cloud to Cloud',\n    'Distribution',\n  ]\n---\n\nexport const Title = () => <span>High Speed File Transfer at the Speed of Business</span>\n\n## Distribute Content Using Aspera on Cloud\n\nYou have seen that you are able to push our data to the cloud and then once in the cloud\nyou can move it around.
