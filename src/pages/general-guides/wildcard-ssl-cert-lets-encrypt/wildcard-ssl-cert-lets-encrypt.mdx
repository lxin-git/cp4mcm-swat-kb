Let's Encrypt can be used to create a free Wilcard certificate for a domain that you
control.

1. Download 'Certbot'. You can download the latest release with wget or clone the Certbot
   repo.

   ```bash
   wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto` & `chmod a+x certbot-auto

   # OR

   git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot.git
   ```

1. Install Certbot: `cd certbot && ./certbot-auto`

1. Generate cert. For example the following can be run to generate a Wildcard cert for the
   domain cp4i.com:

   ```sh
   ./certbot-auto certonly \
   --manual \
   --preferred-challenges=dns \
   --email ryan@example.com \
   --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos \
   -d *.cp4i.com
   ```

1. Set up a DNS TXT entry as per instructions provided from certbot-auto and continue the
   execution of 'certbot-auto' once configured.

   Note: Setting up a DNS TXT entry will be slightly different for each DNS provider.

### That's it

Let's Encrypt will place the certificate assets in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/"$domain"`
directory.

Note: It is common to want to apply this certificate to a Proxy like HAProxy or NGINX. To
do this create a PEM file:

```bash
cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain}/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain}/privkey.pem > /tmp/${domain}.pem
```
