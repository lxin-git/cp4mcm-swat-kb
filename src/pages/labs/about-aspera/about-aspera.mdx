## What is Aspera?

- Aspera is a High Speed File Transfer Platform that leverages the FASP protocol to
  overcome the limitations of other file-transfer technologies. FASP is designed to move
  data of any size, over any IP based network at maximum speed, reliably and securely.
- The name Aspera is an easy way of referring to a stack of interoperable software that
  provides high speed file transfer and streaming capabilities.
- The most basic way of representing the Aspera ecosystem of software is through the
  following stack:

There are a few key concepts this diagram helps depict:

1. FASP is the fundamental layer of all Aspera file transfers regardless of the way in
   which a transfer is initiated.
1. Aspera transfers are a 'Client/Server' architecture. At least one Server must be
   involved in any transfer.
1. There are many different ways of invoking FASP file transfers, each designed to
   accommodate a different type of workflow, these are seen at layer 3 of the diagram.
