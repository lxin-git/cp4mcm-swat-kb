## Downloading from Aspera on Cloud with the Aspera Connect Client

You are now familiar with two different methods of initiating an Aspera transfer; using
the CLI and using the native Aspera Client. Another option is to use the `Aspera Connect`
client application.

Aspera Connect is designed to allow simple FASP uploads and downloads using the browser.
Lets now use the Aspera Connect Client to download the file that contains the token that
you need for the API in the next section of this lab.

## Recap

Aspera on Cloud makes it easy for you to get access to your files no matter where they are
located in the world. In this section you used the Aspera Connect Client to download a
file hosted in AWS S3 Toronto.

Now you have the token you can use the Aspera API to initiate a remote transfer between
the CP4I OpenShift environment and storage connected to Aspera on Cloud.
