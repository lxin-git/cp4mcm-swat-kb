## Aspera ascp CLI

The very first Aspera client was a command line tool called `ascp`. You will start this
lab by using the `ascp` CLI client to download a file from the Aspera hosted Demo Server.

## Using the ascp CLI

1. Open the Terminal app from the desktop of the 'Developer' machine and ensure you are in
   the `/home/ibmuser` directory. You can check this by running `pwd`.

1. Execute the following command to download the file named '100MB' from the Aspera Demo
   Server:

   ```bash
   ascp -O 33001 -P 33001 -l 100M aspera@demo.asperasoft.com:/aspera-test-dir-large/100MB /home/ibmuser
   ```

   When prompted for the password enter: `demoaspera`

   Note: `-O` sets the UDP port, `-P` sets the SSH port & `-l` sets the Target Rate. You
   can read more about the available options of the CLI with `man ascp`.

   The output should look like:

The file named `100MB` has now been download to the `/home/ibmuser` directory. You can run
`ls -lh` to see the new file.

## Scripting the ascp CLI

The `ascp` CLI is a flexible option for initiating FASP transfers. The CLI can easily be
used in new or existing scripts to improve transfer performance, security and management
capabilities. The CLI can replace tools like; scp, ftp, sftp, rsync and other similar tcp
based protocols. Lets look at a quick example of how easy it is to use `ascp` in a script:

1. Export the password as an environment variable so the script can run without user
   interaction:

   ```bash
   export ASPERA_SCP_PASS=demoaspera
   ```

   **Note:** This is not compulsory however if you do not export the password you will be
   prompted for the password each time the script is executed. You also have the option of
   configuring SSH Key based authentication.

1. Execute the `download100MB.sh` script in the `/home/ibmuser` directory by running:

   ```bash
   /home/ibmuser/download100MB.sh
   ```

   ![CLI Download Script](./images/cli-download-script.png)

   You will notice this time the file gets `skipped`. Print the script to the screen:

   ```bash
   cat /home/ibmuser/download100MB.sh
   ```

   If you look at the command being executed in the script you will notice there is an
   additional option added; `-k 1`, this tells ascp to only re-download or resume a file
   download if file attributes are different. In this case the file is identical so there
   is no need to re-download. You can read more about resume-levels (`-k`) and other
   options with `man ascp`.

## Recap

You have just downloaded a file from the Aspera Demo Server using the Aspera `ascp` CLI
client both from the command line and in a script.

Download commands are simple when you know what file is available for download at the
remote side. What happens when you are not familiar with the structure of the remote
filesystem? Next up you will look at improving the end-user experience using the native
Aspera Client GUI that addresses challenges like this.
