## Starting a Node-to-Node Transfer with the Aspera Node API

You are now familiar with the Aspera CLI, Native Client and the Aspera Browser Client. If
you find you would like to take advantage of the transfer speeds, reliability and security
provided out of the box by the FASP protocol but don't want to be handling transfers
manually you can use the
[Aspera API](https://developer.ibm.com/api/view/aspera-prod:ibm-aspera:title-IBM_Aspera#Overview)
to programmatically trigger transfers.

In the previous sections you have performed an upload and a download, there are API's
available that and many other workflows but in this section you will be focusing on the
the API for a node-to-node transfer, i.e. triggering a transfer from one Aspera server to
another. In this section you will move the file `100MB` from the CP4I cluster to IBM Cloud
Object Storage (ICOS) located in the IBM Cloud in Dallas using the '
[Aspera Node API](https://developer.ibm.com/aspera/docs/node-api-reference/)'.

## Lets Go

1. Navigate back to the Terminal on the Developer machine.

1. Move to your Home directory if you are not already there:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   ```

1. Print the contents of the secret that was downloaded in the previous section:

   ```bash
   cat lab5352_secret.txt
   ```

   This is the transfer token that will be used to authenticate the API request.

1. Execute the API call making sure you substitute the two placeholders.

   This API call will initiate an Aspera transfer between the source node, the CP4I
   OpenShift cluster and the remote node, an Aspera Transfer Server running as a service
   in IBM Cloud Dallas connected to IBM Cloud Object Storage.

   Replace the following placeholders:

   - **TOKEN_GOES_HERE**: Should be replaced with the token printed in the previous step.
     Ensure you keep the space after the word 'Basic', the token ends with two equal signs
     `==`.
   - **YOUR_FILENAME_HERE**: Create a unique filename for your file, you can use your lab
     student number as an example. All lab attendees will be sending their file to the
     same IBM ICOS bucket so this way you can identify your file.

   ```bash
   curl -ki -u my_access_key:my_access_key_secret -X POST https://asperahsts.apps.demo.ibmdte.net:443/ops/transfers -d '{"direction": "send", "remote_host": "ats-sl-dal.aspera.io", "remote_user":"xfer","token": "Basic TOKEN_GOES_HERE","paths": [{"source" : "/100MB", "destination": "/YOUR_FILENAME_HERE"}]}'
   ```

1. Once you make the POST an Aspera 'Transfer Spec' will be returned. There is a lot of
   information here but you only need to focus on the ID.

1. Check the status of the file transfer by querying the `/ops/transfers/:id` endpoint
   substituting your ID returned in the Transfer Spec. Replace `TRANSFER_ID_HERE` with the
   ID from the previoud step.

   ```bash
   curl -ki -u my_access_key:my_access_key_secret https://asperanode.apps.demo.ibmdte.net:443/ops/transfers/TRANSFER_ID_HERE
   ```

   If successful the status will be `completed`

1. Navigate back to Aspera on Cloud in Firefox and select `All Files` from the breadcrumb
   to get back to your home view.

   ![Select All Files](./images/api-nav-all-files.png)

1. Select the `IBM ICOS - Dallas` folder to browse the Dallas based Object Storage you
   just sent to.

   ![Select Dallas](./images/api-select-dallas-dir.png)

   You will now be able to see the file named with your custom name. Note: Due to caching
   you may have to wait and refresh after a few minutes before your file appears.

## Recap

You have successfully initiated a remote transfer via the
[Aspera Node API](https://developer.ibm.com/api/view/aspera-prod:ibm-aspera:title-IBM_Aspera#Overview)
between a CP4I OpenShift Cluster with NFS attached storage and an Aspera Transfer Server
running in IBM Cloud connected to IBM Cloud Object Storage located in Dallas.

Next up you will see how simple it is to now move your file between clouds; from IBM Cloud
Object Storage in Dallas to AWS S3 in Frankfurt.
