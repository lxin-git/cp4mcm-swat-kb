## How to embed local images
---

### Step 1: Locate the image
To start you need save the image you wish to embed to your local file system and note the path to the file.

### Step 2: Where to store the file on the site
Once you have locate the file it needs to be saved/stored in the same directory as the article you are writing. 

#### Example:  
I am writing an install article for MCM, so I know I am going to need to store my article and supporting files in the sites file structure.

Base MCM file directory: ```/pages/mcm/```

You will need to create a folder for your article if you have not already done so. I am naming the folder "mcm-install"

The path for the article now looks like this ```/pages/mcm/mcm-install/```

You will need to save your mdx and supporting image files to the /mcm/mcm-install/ (for this example)


```
pages
│
└───mcm    
│   │
│   └───mcm-install
│   │     mcm-install.mdx
│   │     image1.png
│   │     image2.jpg

```

### Step 3: Embedding the image with markdown
Now that the image/s are in the same local direcory as the article (mdx file), the next step is to embed them in the article itself.

You will need to copy the below code into your article

```
![](image.png)
```

Then between the brackets () you need to reference the image in the local directy as in this example
Note: The path reference is needed before the file name.

```
![](./image1.png)
```

Optional: You can give the image a text name by adding the text you wish between the pairens []
This will appear if the cursor is hovered over the image.

```
![MCM login screen](./image1.png)
```

### Step 4: Save the file and prepare for upload
Note: See upload section here



## How to embed web based images
---

### Step 1: Adding the embed code to your article
As the image is already accessible on the internet, it does not need to be stored in the websites filesystem to be refernced. 

**Note:** If the image was moved or removed on the remote site, then the link to your embeded image would also be broken, pick your source wisely.

To add the image simply copy the the below code line into your article.

```
![alt text](https://images.freeimages.com/images/small-previews/5da/puzzle-world-1170892.jpg)
```

Now you can replace the URL between the brackets () to the link of your image you wish to include

### Step 2: Save the file and prepare for upload
Note: See upload section here
