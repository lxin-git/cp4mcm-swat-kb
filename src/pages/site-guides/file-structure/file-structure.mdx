## Overview
---
This article will show you a few options you can use to build and display file / folder structures in your articles clearly.
**Note:** Each example is wrapped in tripple backticks before and after the code. This will keep the file structure formatted correctly when published.
The backticks also allow the website to trim what is shown and provide a dropdown feature. This is helpful if large structure/trees are being used.
 
## Option 1
---
```
IBM Project
│   README.md
│   file001.txt    
│
└───folder1
│   │   file011.txt
│   │   file012.txt
│   │
│   └───subfolder1
│       │   file111.txt
│       │   file112.txt
│       │   ...
│   
└───folder2
    │   file021.txt
    │   file022.txt
```  

## Option 2
---

```
├── _config.yml
├── _drafts
│   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.textile
│   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.markdown
├── _includes
│   ├── footer.html
│   └── header.html
├── _layouts
│   ├── default.html
│   └── post.html
├── _posts
│   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.textile
│   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.textile
├── _data
│   └── members.yml
├── _site
└── index.html
```

## Option 3:

This is not the cleanest looking, but if you are concerned about Unicode characters you can use ASCII to build the structures

```
.
+-- _Folder 1
+-- _Folder 2
|   +-- File_name_1.txt
|   +-- IBM_example_file.markdown
+-- _Folder 3
|   +-- footer.html
|   +-- header.html
+-- _Folder 4
|   +-- default.html
|   +-- post.html
+-- Folder 5
+-- index.html
```
