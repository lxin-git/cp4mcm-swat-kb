## Scenario

You have two or more GitHub accounts at github.com; for example one work and one personal
and would like to authenticate to both using SSH without having to type a password on your
Mac.

GitHub does not allow the use of the same SSH Key across multiple GitHub accounts. Use
this guide to create multiple SSH Keys and assign each key to a specific account so you do
not need to use HTTPS and manually enter your username and password each time you connect
to GitHub.

## Generate SSH Keys

As GitHub does not allow the same SSH Key to be used in multiple GitHub accounts you will
require a unique SSH Key for each account.

1. Generate an SSH Key for use with each account:
   `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

   You may already have a default key created '~/.ssh/id_rsa' this can be used for one
   account.

   You can optionally enter a passphrase to secure the key.
