## Scenario

You have two or more GitHub accounts at github.com; for example one work and one personal
and would like to authenticate to both using SSH without having to type a password on your
Mac.

GitHub does not allow the use of the same SSH Key across multiple GitHub accounts. Use
this guide to create multiple SSH Keys and assign each key to a specific account so you do
not need to use HTTPS and manually enter your username and password each time you connect
to GitHub.

## Generate SSH Keys

As GitHub does not allow the same SSH Key to be used in multiple GitHub accounts you will
require a unique SSH Key for each account.

1. Generate an SSH Key for use with each account:
   `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`

   You may already have a default key created '~/.ssh/id_rsa' this can be used for one
   account.

   You can optionally enter a passphrase to secure the key.

1. Create an SSH Config file:

   ```bash
   # IBM GitHub account
   Host github-ibm
     HostName github.com
     AddKeysToAgent yes
     UseKeychain yes
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     IdentitiesOnly yes

   # Personal GitHub account
   Host github-personal
     HostName github.com
     AddKeysToAgent yes
     UseKeychain yes
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal
     IdentitiesOnly yes
   ```

   Two hosts are configured; 'github-ibm' and 'github-personal' both pointing to
   github.com. When using a Git command using the respective 'Host' name in place of
   github.com will correctly resolve github.com with the respective SSH IdentityFile.

1. Add your SSH Keys to their respective GitHub accounts.

   Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key

1. Test your connection:

   ```sh
   > ssh -T git@github-ibm
   > ssh -T git@github-personal
   ```

   A successful configuration will respond with
   `Hi {username}! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`

## That's it

Depending on the environment you would like to connect to you can replace 'git@github.com'
with 'git@Host' for example 'git remote add origin git@github-personal:ryanhay/test.git'
