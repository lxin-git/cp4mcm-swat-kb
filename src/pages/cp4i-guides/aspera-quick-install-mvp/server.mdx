1. [Download](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/1) and install Aspera High
   Speed Transfer Server (HSTS)

   ```bash
    rpm -Uvh /path_to_installer/${aspera-hsts-version}.rpm --no-deps
   ```

1. Edit the servers SSHD config to support Aspera's default SSH port 33001

   ```bash
    # Open the file for editing
    vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Add the TCP/33001 SSH port and comment out existing config for TCP/22.
    #Port 22
    Port 33001
   ```

   Restart the SSHD service `systemctl restart sshd`

1. Disable Firewalld.

   Note: If you do not want to disable the Firewall please read about the
   [required firewall configuration](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSL85S_3.9.6/hsts_admin_linux/dita/hsts_admin_linux_configuring_the_firewall.html).

   ```bash
    # Stop FirewallD
    systemctl stop firewalld

    # Disable FirewallD
    systemctl disable firewalld
   ```

1. License HSTS by creating the `aspera-license` file and pasting the license text as the
   file contents.

   ```bash
    vi /opt/aspera/etc/aspera-license
   ```

1. Create a new local user that will be used by the client to authenticate to this server.

   Note: Instructions are available for setting up SSH key based auth in the optional
   section of this guide.

   ```bash
    useradd -m -s /bin/aspshell asp1
    passwd asp1
   ```

1. Create a directory that will act as the root directory for file transfers initiated by
   the `asp1` user.

   ```bash
    # Create the directory
    mkdir -p /AsperaRootDir/asp1

    # Update permissions on the directory
    chown asp1:asp1 /AsperaRootDir/asp1
   ```

1. Create default global transfer settings. These settings will be used when a user has
   successfully authenticated to the server but specific settings for the session are not
   present. Navigate to `/opt/aspera/bin` and execute the following:

   ```bash
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_node_data;authorization_transfer_in_value,deny"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_node_data;authorization_transfer_out_value,deny"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_node_data;token_encryption_key,THIS_IS_THE_TOKEN_KEY"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_node_data;absolute,/AsperaRootDir"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_node_data;read_allowed,false;write_allowed,false;dir_allowed,false"

   ```

1. Create user specific transfer settings for the `asp1` user that the client will use to
   connect to the server. These settings have a higher priority than the default settings
   previously configured. Navigate to `/opt/aspera/bin` and execute the following:

   ```bash
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_user_data;user_name,asp1;authorization_transfer_in_value,allow"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_user_data;user_name,asp1;authorization_transfer_out_value,allow"

    # When the asp1 user logs in their root directory will be this directory
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_user_data;user_name,asp1;absolute,/AsperaRootDir/asp1"

    # Target rates are measured in Kbps. The below sets the target rate to 100Mbps
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_user_data;user_name,asp1;transfer_in_bandwidth_flow_target_rate_default,100000"
    ./asconfigurator -x "set_user_data;user_name,asp1;transfer_out_bandwidth_flow_target_rate_default,100000"
   ```

   Note: Each of these commands are updating the Aspera XML config file located at
   `/opt/aspera/etc/aspera.conf`. If you have manually updated any of these settings you
   check the validity of the file with `/opt/aspera/bin/asuserdata -v`.

The Server is now ready to receive connections from the Client.
